Nine out of 10 CHIP parents report satisfaction with their child�s health plan, and 96% received an appointment for check-ups and vaccinations as soon as they wanted. There are a lot of reasons kids might not have health insurance - maybe their parents lost a job, don't have health insurance at work or maybe it just costs too much. Whatever the reason, CHIP may be able to help. All families need to do is apply today.\\n\\n\\nNOW THAT HEALTHCARE REFORM HAS BEGUN, IS CHIP STILL AVAILABLE FOR MY CHILDREN?\\nUninsured Pennsylvania children and teens who are not eligible for Medical Assistance have access to affordable, comprehensive health-care coverage. CHIP is still available for uninsured kids and teens. CHIP is  there for your kids with quality, comprehensive health insurance coverage for routine doctor visits, prescriptions, dental, eye care, prescriptions and much more. All families need to do is apply today. For a full list of covered benefits available through CHIP, click here.\\n\\nI thought CHIP was only for low-income families?\\n\\nParents may think their kids can't get CHIP because they make too much money. Not true! CHIP covers uninsured kids and teens up to age 19 who are not eligible for Medical Assistance.\\n\\nWHAT'S THE COST FOR CHIP COVERAGE?\\n\\nFor most families, it's free. Families with incomes above the free CHIP limits will pay low monthly premiums and co-pays for some services. View comprehensive income information (PDF).\\n\\nHOW DOES CHIP PUT INSURANCE WITHIN REACH?\\n\\nCHIP is brought to you by leading health insurance companies who offer your kids quality, comprehensive coverage. You'll have a choice of major insurance companies with large networks of physicians, specialists and care facilities near you.  In fact, your kids may even be able to keep visiting the same doctors they see now. Find a CHIP health insurance company in your county.\\n\\nHOW LONG IS MY CHILD COVERED ONCE THEY ARE ENROLLED IN CHIP?\\n\\nOnce enrolled, children are guaranteed 12 months of CHIP coverage unless they no longer meet the basic eligibility requirements. Families must renew their coverage every year in order for the coverage to continue. CHIP insurance companies send renewal notices 90 days before their benefits are going to end, and families must fill out and send the renewal information back to their CHIP insurance company in order for benefits to continue.\\n\\nI recently gained legal custody of my grandchildren. They are uninsured and need health benefits. Can I apply for CHIP for them?\\n\\nYes! Any legal guardian who is exercising care and control of the children, can apply for CHIP.\\n\\nMY CHILD HAS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. WILL THAT AFFECT OUR ELIGIBILITY?\\n\\nPre-existing conditions are covered. There are no exclusions for pre-existing conditions in CHIP or Medical Assistance. However, if your child has a serious medical condition or disability, he or she may be considered for Medical Assistance.\\n\\nDOES CHIP HAVE A WAITING LIST?\\n\\nNo. There is no waiting list to enroll in CHIP.\\n\\nI HAVE MORE QUESTIONS. CAN I TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT CHIP?\\n\\nCouldn't find the answer you're looking for? Maybe it's under another category in our FAQ section. Check it out. Or, find a CHIP insurance company in your county and give them a call!\\n\\n\\n\""
